# DevConnector
Developer Social Site

This is a project I worked on while learning Redux. It was built using Mongo, Express, React-Redux, Node.

Users can create profiles, and connect with other web developer users. The app uses the Github api to pull a users 
github repository on to their profile page. 

Users can create posts, as well as like, and comment on posts.
